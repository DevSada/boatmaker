			<h3 align="center">The principle is simple: owners can create a free listing for their boat by adding pictures, a description, a price, and some advice about the sailing area. Renters can then contact them directly with the BoatMaker messaging service to ask any questions. Owners can access the sailing CV of the renter and can confidently choose the right sailors for their boats.
			<br>
			Renters can choose between several hundred boats in within a sailing area, benefiting from comments from previous renters and can contact the owner to ensure that their planned sailing trip will go off without a hitch. Why not start by searching for a boat?
